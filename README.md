# SlowPizza üçï
Like [QuickPizza](https://github.com/grafana/quickpizza) but with gRPC. SlowPizza is a small service to test or debug gRPC connections, locally or in the cloud. Unlike what its name implies, it actually runs quickly.

Based on some of the examples in the [gRPC-Go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/tree/master/examples/features) repository.
